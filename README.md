BioAid - The biologically inspired hearing aid
===========================================

For more information and documentation visit **[BIOAID.ORG.UK](http:///bioaid.org.uk)**

The /src folder contains the C++ source

The /extras folder contains some Matlab test scripts. Maybe I'll put some VST plugin code in the extras folder at some point.

## Compilation

The C code can be compiled using the Makefile (tested only on Linux).

Requirements:

- g++
- make
- boost library

In order to perform the compilation go the /src folder and run the command:

~~~.{makefile}
make
~~~
